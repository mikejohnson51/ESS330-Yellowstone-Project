    "The data that we are looking at comes from a study conducted by David Cooper and Tom Hobbs of Colorado State University. Their study investigated Salix height as a response to browsing and the water table ([Cooper & Hobbs, 2023](#ref-cooper)).For our study, we are interested in the relationship between wolf population count and grazer population counts (elk and bison). The first dataset that we are using from Cooper & Hobbs is a bison data csv which includes\n",
